# GODOT---Fps-shooter-recoil-system
Godot at the moment doesnt have any tutorials about recoil, so I decided to make a project that the community and I will make together so that everyone can use it! 
The goal for this repo is to create a usable and satisfiing recoil system, that includes recoil increasing, recoil dampening and even more, the recoil should be similer to common fps shooters like call of duty, and battlefield
, even though they are different games I want to create a system that can be changed and tuned to be both or unique!

I need the communities help, as I am still very inexperienced in the fps genre and I am still learning I have made a project that everyone can download, test and change it
to their liking!
